# CGIAR-Eyes-on-the-Ground-Challenge-Zindi-Competition-
The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to Predict drought damage from smartphone images of crops.

The challenge is hosted on Zindi.

## Steps to reproduce results:

Run `Create Folds.ipynb` to produce train_folds.csv which we will use to train the model.

Run `Train.ipynb` to train the model.

`N.B: I only use one fold because the model take too much to train.`

Run `Inference.ipynb` to make predictions on the test dataset.
